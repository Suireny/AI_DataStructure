= Why does a game that is 60GB run smoothly 16GB

- When you load a game it needs to temporarily store variables, baked textures, 3D-models and other
 game-related files to the RAM like any other software. This is done because retrieving from the RAM is faster than
 from a HDD. But to load all of the required data to the RAM for a game of this scale isn't
 a really good idea. Besides, it doesn't have enough space anyways.
