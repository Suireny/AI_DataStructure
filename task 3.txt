= what is the virtual memory?

- Virtual memory is a common technique used in a computer's operating system (OS).

- Virtual memory uses both hardware and software to enable a computer to compensate for physical memory shortages,
 temporarily transferring data from (RAM) to disk storage.

- Virtual memory frees up RAM by swapping data that has not been used recently over to a storage device,
 such as a hard drive or solid-state drive (SSD).

- Virtual memory was developed at a time when RAM was expensive.
