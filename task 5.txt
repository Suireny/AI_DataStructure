= Whyare there programming languages that are faster than others?

- compiling
- the cost of automation
- Compiler Efficiency
> A C language compiler will produce assembly (native) code, trusting the programmer to do the right thing.
> A Rust compiler will produce safer code, like not allowing to write data beyond the bounds of an array.
> A Java compiler uses garbage collection as well, and bytecode, so it has a virtual machine that must interpret this code.
> A Go compiler relies on garbage collection to free memory (Rust uses different tricks).
 Thatâ€™s a separate process that must clean unused memory, and it costs CPU cycles (but this is simpler for programmers).
