Complexity measure


Complexity measure / measure of complexity may refer to any measure defined in various branches of complexity theory, specifically:

~ in Computational complexity theory
= Blum axioms

= Halstead complexity measures
= Cyclomatic complexity
= Time complexity
= Parametrized complexity
~ in complex systems theory and applications
= Forecasting complexity
= Effective complexity
= Kolmogorov complexity, a measure of algorithmic complexity
= Self-dissimilarity
~ in information theory
= Information fluctuation complexity
~ in model theory
= U-rank
~ in statistical learning theory / computational learning theory
= VC dimension
= Rademacher complexity
~ in linguistics/computer linguistics
linguistic sequence complexity
~ in computer networks
= network complexity
